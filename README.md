# The Tea Party a Developers Brew
## Description
We wanted to make an place where developers, coders, and anyone else could come to get
help and colaberation in projects and groups. To also share luaghs and vent away the pain.
A cafe on the internet.

## Usage
A place for developers experienced and not to collaperate and get advice on projects,
to vent about issues with the code, and to post silly pictures and memes of any and all
things relayted to code. 
As well as eventually a place to see if a job is a good enviorment or a black company to work for.
